# System Design Project
System Design Capstone to replace an existing API with a back end system that can support large scale data set and can scale to meed the demands of large scale web traffic.


This project is built to design a database and server that meets the business requirements of an existing front end application. The project is deployed and scaled to support a minimum of 100 requests per second on a EC2 using a t2.micro instance (the lowest configuration possible at AWS at this time of writing the README)
